## Overview

Kanak Attack is an app designed for Manoa campus. It gives the ability to vendors to maintain an active menu update special items and list items as in stock or sold out. The items can be by ingredients, cuisine or other things. The user will have the ability to select what type of cuisine they would like. On top of this they will be able to filter food items by ingredients etc... The overall purpose of this app is to display available items around campus so the user can make the best choice of food for their personal interest.

* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
* [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) CSS Framework for UI design.
* [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) for React and Semantic UI-based form design and display.

It also provides code that implements a variety of useful design concepts, including:

* We will have three user roles (vendor, consumer, and admin) in which the vendors can update the app to include available menu options, changes or specials.
* Top-level index pages (Favorite foods, favorite ingredients, and favorite cuisine) that show how to manipulate these collections in various ways.
* Initialization code to define default Profiles, Favorites, and Cuisines and relations between them.
* A simple Filter page to illustrate how to perform simple queries on the database and display the results.
* Use of Meteor Methods to illustrate how to simplify implementation of multiple collection updates.
* Use of indexes to enforce uniqueness of certain fields in the collections, enabling them to serve as primary keys.
* Authentication using the built-in Meteor accounts package along with Sign Up and Sign In pages.
* Authorization examples: certain pages are public (Profiles, Foods, Places), while other pages require login (Favorites, Filter).
* Use of Meteor Assets to initialize the database (helpful when initialization exceeds settings file size limits).
